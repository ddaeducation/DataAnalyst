        "#### Introduction:\n",
        "In Python, a variable is a symbolic name that is associated with a value and can be used to reference that value in your code. Variables are fundamental to programming as they allow you to store, modify, and retrieve data. Unlike some programming languages, Python does not require explicit declaration of variable types; it dynamically assigns the type based on the value assigned to the variable. This flexibility makes Python a powerful and user-friendly language for both beginners and experienced programmers.\n",
